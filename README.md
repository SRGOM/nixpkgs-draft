# nixpkgs-draft
Please submit your custom nixpkgs here if they need fixes before being included in nixpkgs and you cannot afford to spend time on this. Please do remember that NixOS is a volunteer run project and hence *very* short on time. 

## Steps for submission: 

1) Create a new directory at the root of this repository.
