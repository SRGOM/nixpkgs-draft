Brief description:

No colorpicker in nixpkgs right now! gpick is probably the most popular and yet unavailable because of compilation issues, took me upwards of 10 hours to figure out...

Source/motivation:

Package is in official arch repo. 

Status:

Works perfectly on my machine.

ToDo:

use the `callPackage` style
